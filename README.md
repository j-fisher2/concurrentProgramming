# Python Concurrency Exploration

## Introduction

This project explores different concurrency approaches in Python using threads, asynchronous, and multiprocessing approaches/libraries. The goal is to demonstrate how concurrency can improve efficiency and reduce execution time compared to sequential programming.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- No additional libraries are required, as the standard libraries (`time`, `threading`, `asyncio`, and `multiprocessing`) will be used.
